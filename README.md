# V7 Product Interview Task

Thank you for taking the time to do this task! This repo contains a very basic reproduction of the Go table view and an empty page for the entity view.

- The styling is intentionally simple, and should not be used as an indication of how
  we expect you to style your submission.
- Feel free to use any styling solution; Tailwind, SASS, vanilla CSS - or anything else that you feel will showcase your ability to create a delightful UI!
- Given the time constraints, we don't expect high test coverage, but small sample tests are appreciated.
- We built this app with Vue, but you won't be judged on your mastery of Vue - we understand that you might not have prior experience with it. Mastery of web standards and Javascript are more important.

## What we expect

- A dismissable command center that is triggered with CMD+K/CTRL+K
  - The commands should trigger UI updates
- Integration with Go through the [API](https://docs.go.v7labs.com/)
- HTML that follows web standards
- Well-styled UI components
- Attention to detail regarding user interaction and experience
- It should work :)
- Have fun :tada:

We expect you to take 2-4 hours completing this task. The potential scope is
extremely large, but you should focus on the features you feel would be the
most impactful. We value polished features over breadth of scope.

If you have any questions, then please email your contact within our talent team.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
